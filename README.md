1. Download the client_lab8.py and server_lab8.py Python files.


2. Run the server Python file first. You should be prompted to input a valid private IP address and a port number.

```
Enter IP address to bind to (e.g., 127.0.0.1): 
Enter port number to bind to (e.g., 65432):
```
It should output this. 
```
(The x and p are valid entry numbers for IP address and port number)
Server listening on xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:ppppp...
```

3. Then run the client Python program. Input the public IP address and the same port number used for the server program.
```
Enter IP address to bind to (e.g., 127.0.0.1): 
Enter port number to bind to (e.g., 65432):
```

This is the output when there is a successful Server and Client connection.


```
Connected by ('xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx', ppppp)
