(Pycharm IDE was used)

___
1. Download the client_lab8.py and server_lab8.py Python files. 

2. Run the server Python file first. You should be prompted to input a valid IP address and a port number.

#### For local run of this program, use your private IP and an arbitrary port number for the Server Program.
* Private IP: 10.39.57.168  
* Port: 12345

#### For public run of this program, use the public IP and port number provided to connect via our server-client connection.
* Private IP: #  
* Port: #

```
#Prompts user to input a IP address and port number:

Enter IP address to bind to (e.g., 127.0.0.1): 
Enter port number to bind to (e.g., 65432):
```
---
It should output this if successful binding:
```
(The x and p are valid entry numbers for IP address and port number)
Server listening on xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:ppppp...
```

3. Then run the client Python program. Input the public IP address and the same port number used for the server program.
```
Enter IP address to bind to (e.g., 127.0.0.1): 
Enter port number to bind to (e.g., 65432):
```

This is the output when there is a successful Server and Client connection.


```
Connected by ('xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx', ppppp) successfully.
